Currency Selectors: Choose the source and target currencies.

Buttons:

Convert: Fetches live exchange rates from the API and calculates the converted amount.

Swap Currencies: Switches the source and target currencies.

Real-Time Data:

Uses the ExchangeRate-API to fetch live currency rates.

Caching is implemented to reduce unnecessary API calls.
